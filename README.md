# Moodle (local) — Repository

This repository contains the local Moodle site files prepared for development and safe testing.

- Webroot: `D:\Moodle\server\moodle`
- Dataroot (ignored): `D:\Moodle\server\moodledata`
- Backups: `D:\Moodle\backups`

This repo was initialized by the assistant to track code and small helper files. Large runtime artifacts (database dumps, dataroot, vendor, and binaries) are intentionally ignored.

Next steps:
- Add a remote and push if you want this repo tracked remotely.
- Tell me if you want me to commit more Moodle-specific files or create a branch for plugin development.
